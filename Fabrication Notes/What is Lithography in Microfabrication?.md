Lithography is pattering on a subtrate. In microfabrication there are several types of lithorgraphy. Mainly:

- Photolithography (Optical; DUV, EUV)
	- The most widely used method in semiconductor manufacturing
	- Uses a mask to transfer certain patterns onto a [[What is Photoresist?|photoresist]] covered substrate 
	- Can create small features, typically a few nanometers depending on the technique
	- Relatively easy to scale to production (hence why everyone uses it)
	- Feature size of ~7-200 nm
- X-Ray Lithography
	- Can create very small features (0.1 - 10 nanometers)
	- Less common due to high cost and complexity
	-  [[What is Photoresist?|Photoresist]] is used. Uses a mask to transfer features
- Electron Lithography
	- Maskless
	- Can create features around 1-10 nanometers
	- Very slow 
	- Generally used for either prototyping or mask production for photolithography at scale (since you only need one mask per design per photolithography station)
	- Uses resist. Electrons break the bonds which makes the substrate soluble
- Ion Beam Lithography
	- Extremely high resolution and can be used for etching (<10 nanometers)
	- Very slow and hard to scale to production
	- Can use resist or can be resistless
	- Uses no masks
	- Directly sputters ions from the substrate
- Scanning Probe Lithography
	- Atomic level precision (<1nm )
	- Scratches the surface of the substrate to etch 
	- Extremely slow and not scaleable. Only used in research cases typically
