Doping is the process of putting a new material inside of another material (generally in an interstitial manner) to modify its properties in some manner. These new materials are called [[Dopants]].

#### Passive Doping

This is the process of doping where you heat a target material and introduce doping material nearby and let diffusion intersperse the doping material in to the target material lattice. This method is slow, simple, and generally leaves higher concentrations near the surface of the target material.

#### Active Doping

The two main steps of Active doping are:
- Ion implantation
- Drive-in Diffusion

#### Ion Implantation

This is a very important technique for microelectronics. This involves putting ions of a different type (generally with either 3 or 5 valence electrons) into a semiconductor or material (typically silicon) to add additional charge carriers in the material. This is typically done by using a particle accelerator and bombarding the substrate.

#### Drive-in Diffusion

After ion implantation, the material is usually slighlty disfigured and many of the dopants are clustered. The material is then covered with a thin layer of the dopants and heated (annealed) to redistribute internal dopants internally and near the surface.
