Doping is the process of putting a new material inside of another material (generally in an interstitial manner) to modify its properties in some manner.

The two main steps of doping are:
- Ion implantation
- Drive-in Diffusion

#### Ion Implantation

This is a very important technique for microelectronics. This involves putting ions of a different type (generally with either 3 or 5 valence electrons) into a semiconductor or material (typically silicon) to add additional charge carriers in the material. This is typically done by using a particle accelerator and bombarding the substrate.

#### Drive-in Diffusion

After ion implantation, the material is usually slighlty disfigured and many of the dopants are clustered. The material is then covered with a thin layer of the dopants and heated (annealed) to redistribute internal dopants internally and near the surface.
