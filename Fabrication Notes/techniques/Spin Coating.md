This is the simplest method for fabricating thin films. In microfabrication this is very commonly used to coat substrates with [[Photoresist|photoresist]] for [[Lithography|photolithography]]. 

For this method, the material is mixed into a solvent, dripped onto the substrate, and then the substrate is spun and centrifugal forces flatten the mixture out across the substrate. While spinning, part of the solvent is evaporated to maintain a rigid structure. After spinning is finished, the substrate is then baked again to fully evaporate the solvent, leaving the thin film deposited on the surface.

This technique results in a planar surface even if the substrate itself is not planar.

Other methods for photoresist deposition are also: 
- dry lamination
- dip coating
- spray coating
- electrodeposition
