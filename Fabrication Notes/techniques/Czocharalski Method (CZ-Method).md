The most commonly used method for creating [[Single Crystalline Silicon]]. The method follows this process

##### Process
- Melt high purity polycrystalline silicon in a quartz crucible
- Introduce [[Dopants]] (optional)
- Insert a small single crystal silicon crystal seed with known orientation ([[Miller Indices]])
- Slowly pull up and rotate. This will grow silicon onto the seed in the selected orientation
