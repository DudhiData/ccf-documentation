Physical vapor deposition creates thin films on substrates directly from the source as opposed to using chemical properties.

This technique covers two distinct deposition techniques known as sputtering and evaporation

### Evaporation 

Evaporation deposits thin films on a substrate using sublimation of a heated source material in a vacuum. The vapor flux then coats the surface of the substrate. Based on how the material is heated you can separate into  
- Vacuum thermal evaporation (VTE)
	- One of the most common
	- Uses resistive, laser, or magnetic induction heating
- Electron beam evaporation (EBE)
	- One of the most common
	- Electron beam is focused on target material to melt it
- Molecular beam epitaxy (MBE)
- Reactive evaporation (RE)

Alloys are typically not deposited using evaporation since the process is not as stable as sputtering them.

### Sputtering

Uses a flux of atoms which are released from the target material by bombarding it with chemically inter atoms such as argon. Bombards atoms (like argon) by applying an electric field and creating a plasma which is then sent to the cathode surface (which is the target material). The bombardment knocks out target atoms which then condense on the substrate surface as a thin film.

A positive of sputtering is that it can be used on all kinds of materials including alloys, insulators, and piezoelectric ceramics.
