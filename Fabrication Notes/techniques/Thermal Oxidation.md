Thermal Oxidation is the process of using high heat to create an oxidation layer on a substrate. It is typically used to deposit and create a thin layer of silicon dioxide on silicon. Although [[Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD)]] can be used, its typically easier to use thermal oxidation.

Thermal oxidation can allow for the adjusting of gaps and channels in materials with sub-micrometer accuracy in devices.

### Wet Oxidation vs Dry Oxidation

Depedning on the oxidizer, thermal oxidation can be classified as either dry or wet. Dry oxidation uses O2 gas as the oxidizer and reacts at hight temperatures (800-1200 celsius). Wet oxidation uses water vapor as the oxidizer
