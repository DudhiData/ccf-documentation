Monolithic silicon that is in one solid crystal structure as opposed to multiple grains is called single crystalline silicon. Its orientation can be described using [[Miller Indices]]. 

Single crystalline silicon can be created using the [[Czocharalski Method (CZ-Method)]] or the [[Floating Zone Method (FZ-Method)]].
