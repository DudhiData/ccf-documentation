Silicon on Insulator is a wafer structure where a silicon dioxide is placed in the middle of a monolithic pure silicon substrate via [[Doping]]. This allows fewer parasitic effects and improves performance of the transistors on the wafer.

The process to make this wafer structure is called [[Separation by Implantation of Oxygen (SIMOX)]].
